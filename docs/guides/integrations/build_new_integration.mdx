## Integration Development

Poozle support ticketing integrations currently. A integration takes the form of a build javascript file which follows the [Poozle specification](/understanding-poozle/protocol).

To build a new integration in Typescript, we provide templates so you don't need to start everything from scratch.

<Note>
  You are not required to maintain the integrations you create. The goal is that
  Poozle and the community maintain the integration.
</Note>

### Creating a integration from a template

```bash
cd integration-bases/generator
yarn
yarn generate
```

This will generate a new integration in the integrations/ticketing/{your-integration} directory. As you implement here
are 3 things to keep in mind.

1. Search the generated directory for "TODO"s and follow them to implement your integration.
2. You can also check the README to check how to test the integration.
3. Make sure to review the [Github integration](https://github.com/poozlehq/poozle/tree/main/integrations/ticketing/github) which we wrote for better understanding.

<Warning>
  We are still trying to streamline this process. You have any questions kindly
  reach out to us in slack.
