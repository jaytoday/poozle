  For a more automated approach, consider creating OAuth apps using our [Create API](/api-reference/oauth/create_oauth){" "}
</Tip>

Adding a custom OAuth app requires registration of the application with the API provider to obtain the Client ID and Client Secret. Don't forget to register required scopes with both the API provider and on the OAuth page.
