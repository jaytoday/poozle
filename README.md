    <em>Poozle is an open-source single API for Product Integrations
</em>
</p>

Poozle provides complete devtooling around product integrations. Companies need to extract their customers' data tools like Github, Jira, Notion, Zendesk, Salesforce etc. Hence in the journey companies end up building their own integration infrastructure. Poozle provides a single API for the same that enables companies to integrate multiple of these tools at once. We do the hard work of integrating and smoothing them and exposing developers to a clean and unified interface. We aim to make it easy for companies to build new integrations.


## One Data model
Don't muck with data transformations and API quirks. Common Models provide normalized, constantly synced data for each category of integrations.
